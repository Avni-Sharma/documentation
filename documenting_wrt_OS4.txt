STEPS TO LOGIN TO OC WITH A USER1 GROUP 

User1 is a group that has been created by the kubeadmin. This group will have
certain roles to be associated with it. We need to bind the roles with the
suitable group to achieve the desired result of logging in as user1and not
kubeadmin.

Firstly
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kubeconfig

login to OS4 using kubeadmin as the user login 
`oc login -u kubeadmin -p ***`

From the UI:
Go to Administration -> Cluster Settings -> Global Configuration -> OAuth ->
Identity Providers -> Add HTPasswd  (Upload a password file under this
subsection. That would be the password for user1 login group)
You can change the name of the group in the YAML.

htpasswd -c users.htpasswd user1

oc create clusterrolebinding basic-user --clusterrole=basic-user --user=user1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you can login as a -u user1 with -p <password file>

After this create a role or edit the yaml in the existing basic-user role with
the following yaml 

  - verbs:
      - get
      - list
    apiGroups:
      - operators.coreos.com
    resources:
      - clusterserviceversions

and save it. 
Now you can login as user1 and run `oc get csvs`
